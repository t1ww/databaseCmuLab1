 [Extra credit] What problem have you found when you are dealing with the tradition database
 files? Explain in detail?
    >
        1.lack of management ( the data is hard to find or search through and data can be misarranged or duplicated )
        2.lack of sharing usage potential ( information cannot be access from afar by many different users )
        3.lack of security ( anyone can possibly access my file by snuggling in or breaking in )
        4.can be easily destroyed ( file is kept physically so if the place that stored data has an incident file might be gone with it )
